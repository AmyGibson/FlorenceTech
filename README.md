This is an Ionic 3 mobile app that aid carers to look after dementia patients. This is part of a research project and I can only share the functional skeleton without any actual content/assets.

Functions in this app include:

1. User account management (linked to a MySQL database)
2. Add/edit user profile, life story, family relations, personal interests, health condition, and daily schedule
3. Link to the user's Flickr account if they want to add photos to any of their stories
4. A calendar for scheduling medical and social appointments
5. Suggesting conversation topics or activities when carers are out of ideas
6. Link to the user's Spotify account for music suggestion
7. An inbuilt social network (work-in-progress) for carers to meet other carers
